# Project VibeZ

	SOEN 341 Social Media Project Winter 2020

## Objective

	Develop a simplified version of Instagram

## Project description

	Using social media may be a frustrating experience. Expressing your true opinion on content posted
	by these "influencers" or even your friends may be a daunting task, and let's be honest, you don't
	want all the attention and hate coming your way from their fans. Introducing VibeZ, the social
	media platform that keeps it 100% real (but you can do so anonymously). Is your friend being annoying?
	Do you want to tell them your real opinion but don't want to hurt their feelings? Give them a vibe
	check, and maybe others might just be thinking the same. Is what that influencer says #fact?
	Support them with that vibe check too.

## Core features

    1. Ability to post pictures
		Users want to share their pictures to either their friends/connections or to the public. Their followers will receive notification once a new post is released. The pictures uploaded need to be stored in the users directory/profile page. A profile page will present all pictures uploaded in a chronological order.

    2. Ability to follow users
		When a user is interested in another's profile and wishes to receive a notification if there are some updates from that profile, a request to follow can be sent to the owner of the profile from the user. When a user receives a request, that person has three options including accept, decline or ignore. If the person chooses to accept, the name of the senders will be added to the user's follower list. And, they can receive notification, see updates from the user from their news feed. If the user chooses to decline, the request will be removed from the pending request of the user, no change is required for the senders. The ignore option requires no action.

    3. Leave comment on pictures
		After being posted, pictures can be commented by followers. The comments will be presented vertically in a chronological order. The newest one will be always on top. 

## Extra features

 	1. Rating system: what is the "vibe" of the content the user sees.
	   This feature allows for negative ratings, i.e. if user finds the content
	   offensive. There are default vibes and custom vibes (a word) dynamically
	   added by users/followers. This feature is similar to existing feature in Slack.
	   However, users may decide to react using custom "vibes" made by other users.

    2. News feed similar to Instagram
